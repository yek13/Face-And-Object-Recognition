# Face-and-Object-Recognition
Face and Object Recognition with Tkinter
The project was written in python and PyCharm was used.

The faster_rcnn_resnet101_coco_2018_01_28 folder in the object detection folder is empty. https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md you can download the folder from this link. Or you can use it by downloading the model you want.
When the FaceRecognition.py file is executed, the face recognition process form is running. The data obtained from the faces-train.py file ilw was trained.
When you update the data yourself, you need to run faces-train.py once.

For object recognition, you must run the objectdetection.py file.

You need to use PyCharm to run the project.

Some libraries must be installed for the project to work. You can download these libraries from the command line. You can also download it from PyCharm by clicking File> Settings> Project: ...> Project Interpreter (I used the method).
